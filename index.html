                This is a photo of me in the Palace of Versailles! 
                This was taken last summer, when my economics teacher invited me and a select group of seniors to go to France and Switzerland.
                The summer of 2023 was easily the best summer I have ever had so far!

            <h2 class="subtitle">My Studies</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a computer engineering major at the University of Maryland, College Park.
                For honors, I am part of the Business, Society, and Economy Scholars program, which helps students like me
                build effective networking skills, learn enterprise communications, and understanding types of businesses and
                how they operate. As a sophomore, I am learning C programming in CMSC 216, and understanding digital logic design,
                signal analysis, and electric circuits through ENEE 244, ENEE 222, and ENEE 205.

            <p>
                I am a big fan or intrumural sports at UMD. They are not as time consuming as club sports, 
                and they can still give you good physical activity for the day.
                Last year, my friends and I did intrumural flag football, both 7v7 and 4v4, but this year,
                we will be doing 7v7, and instead of 4v4 flag football, we will be creating a basketball team.
                Let's see if we win it this year!
